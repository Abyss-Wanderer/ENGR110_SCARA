---Test Cases---
Cases that will test if the control system can meet the functional requirements laid out by the lab script.

- Singularities - 
A singularity can occur when j1 and j2 attempt to move so that they are separated by a distance greater than that of the two
arms connected to the tool fully extended. So we should test that the system can recognize when this is about to happen and 
find an alternate path to draw the point (if one exists).

- Drawing Capabilities -
The system must be able to draw
-A line (as straight as possible)
-Curves
-Shapes, i.e. a square (we are assessed on how close the start and end points are) and a circle (assessed on how smooth the
curve is)
-(For completion) have the ability to write words (i.e. "skynet")
-(For challenge) have the ability to draw pictures (i.e. snowman and elf)
